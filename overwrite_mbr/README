These projects will overwrite the mbr on Windows.  Obviously you need to run as Administrator or they won't work.  Additionally,
make sure that you select the correct build options, if you don't use the included project/solution files.  If not, they will
look for the version of .NET you built against and fail to run properly if it's not on the target machine.
