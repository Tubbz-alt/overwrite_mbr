These programs overwrites the beginning of sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, sde, sdf, sdg, hda, hdb, hdc, hdd, hde, hdf, and hdg (if they exist).  Obviously, they will need to be run as root (or poorly configured permissions on the device files).  This will probably mess up any other drives plugged in to the target computer at the time these programs are run, in addition to the boot one.  This is done so that we can be absolutely sure we overwrited the boot drive.  In the future, these programs could be extended to include a check for a /boot/ directory on the device before overwriting it.
